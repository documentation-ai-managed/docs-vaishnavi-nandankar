## Document Organization and Folders

Organize your documentation into logical structures using folders. Create nested hierarchies to group related pages, such as API references under a `docs/api` folder or tutorials under `guides`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to the root or any parent folder. Click the `New Folder` button and enter a name like `features`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Documents" icon="file-plus">
    Inside the folder, create new pages. Drag and drop to reorder or nest further.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Structure" icon="settings">
    Use the sidebar to collapse/expand folders and rename via right-click.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Limit folder depth to three levels for optimal navigation. Use clear, descriptive names like `user-guide` instead of vague terms.

Track every change with built-in version history. View diffs, restore previous versions, and collaborate safely.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,UI">
  ```bash
  # Checkout a specific version
  git checkout v1.2.0 docs/features.mdx

  # View diff
  git diff HEAD~1 docs/features.mdx
  ```
  ```javascript
  // API example to fetch versions
  const versions = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/versions?path=features.mdx');
  console.log(versions);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Workflow" default-open="false">

  1. Enable branching for experiments.
